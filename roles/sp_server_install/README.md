### Offerings dictionary can be used to install only required components. 
#### By default role install all the offerings. Override the below dictionary in your playbook/vars file to install only required components.
```
offerings:
  server: true
  stagent: true
  devices: true
  oc: true
  ossm: true
```

## Role Workflow
### When `sp_server_state` is `present`:
1. Validates system compatibility (architecture, disk space, etc.).
2. Checks if the specified version is available in the repository on control node.
3. Determines the appropriate action based on the installed version:
   - If specified sp_server_version > already installed version, role performs upgrade of SP Server.
   - If no version is installed, it proceeds with installation.
4. Installs the SP Server if the system meets the requirements.
5. If Installation fails completely or for some components, the system is rolled-back to previous state and removes the components which were installed.
6. If Server is already installed and role is executed with state as `present`, then role will `configure` the server.
7. Two types of configuration can be achieved
   1. If `server_blueprint` is set to `true` and `server_size` is specified, role implements the blueprint. Refer the `Server Blueprint Implementation` section for detailed info.
   2. If `server_blueprint` is set to `false` (default value), it just configures the server and does not create the policy domains, storage pools, management classes, schedules related to client and db backup. Useful when just needed a server where clients can be registered for testing purpose.

### When `sp_server_state` is `upgrade`:
1. Checks the installed version and determines if an upgrade is necessary.
2. Performs the upgrade, ensuring existing configurations are retained.

### When `sp_server_state` is `absent`:
1. Stops the dsmserv processes.
2. Drops the db2 instance.
3. If `server_blueprint` is set to true, during cleanup role internally calls the `ibm.storage_protect.storage_prepare` role to remove the configuration. Set this value to true only if the server was configured  with `server_blueprint` directive as true.
4. Uninstalls the SP Server, and remove's all related packages and instance directories.


## SP Server Blueprint Specific Variables
| Variable                     | Default Value                | Description                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dbbk_password`            | `YourDBkPassword@@123456789` | Specifies the password that is used to protect the database backups.                                          |
| `server_name`                | `Server1`                    | Set the server name for server 2 server communication.                                                        |
| `server_password`               | `IBMSPServer@@123456789`     | Specifies a password for the server. Include symbols uppercase,lowercase and numbers in your password.        |
| `server_size`               | `xsmall`                     | Specifies the size of server to be deployed.                                                                  |
| `maxcap`               | `100G`                       | Specifies the maximum size of any data storage files that are defined to a storage pool in this device class. |
| `dbbk_streams`               | `4`                          | Specifies the number of parallel data movement streams to use when you back up the database.                                                                                                              |

```yml
act_log_size:
  xsmall: 24576
  small: 131072
  medium: 131072
  large: 524032
```

```yml
# The MAXSESSIONS specifies the maximum number of simultaneous client sessions that can connect with the server.
max_sessions:
  xsmall: 75
  small: 250
  medium: 500
  large: 1000
```
## Server Blueprint Implementation Workflow:
1. To implement the server blueprint, set the `server_blueprint` directive to true.
2. Based on the value of `server_size`, role will configure the server with parameters as specified in the blueprint document.
3. Role also creates required policy domains, schedules, management classes and db backup related schedules. Refer the blueprint document for detailed information.
4. It is required to explicitly use `ibm.storage_protect.storage_prepare` role to configure the storage for required size before implementing the blueprint. It uses some facts which are set by `storage_prepare` role.See the documentation of `ibm.storage_protect.storage_prepare` role for detailed information.
5. As of now, role just creates the schedules for `IBM Spectrum Protect backup- archive client`.
6. Schedules related to other clients will be added in next releases.

## Example Playbooks
- Example playbooks are available under the playbooks directory of [IBM/ansible-storage-protect](https://github.com/IBM/ansible-storage-protect/tree/main/playbooks/) github repo.
- The `target_hosts` variable allows you to dynamically specify the target hosts or host group at runtime.
- If `target_hosts` is not provided, the playbook defaults to using "all" hosts from your inventory.
Make sure the specified target_hosts exist in your inventory file (INI, YAML, or dynamic inventory).

To install SP Server:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ibm.storage_protect.sp_server_install_playbook.yml --extra-vars '{"sp_server_bin_repo":"/path/to/repo/on/controlNode", "sp_server_state": "present", "sp_server_version": "8.1.23", "ssl_password": "YourPassword@123"}'
```

To upgrade SP Server:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ibm.storage_protect.sp_server_install_playbook.yml --extra-vars '{"sp_server_bin_repo":"/path/to/repo/on/controlNode", "sp_server_state": "upgrade", "sp_server_version": "8.1.24", "ssl_password": "YourPassword@123"}'
```

To configure SP Server with default values:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ibm.storage_protect.sp_server_configure_playbook.yml
```
To uninstall SP Server:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ibm.storage_protect.sp_server_uninstall_playbook.yml
```

## Server Blueprint Implementation
- Example playbook for server blueprint is available in playbooks directory of collection.
- This playbook performs installation,storage preparation and configuration as mentioned in blueprint document.
- Predefined vars files are created for server blueprint implementation, which can be directly used to execute the playbook using below command.
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ibm.storage_protect.sp_server_blueprint_playbook.yml -e @vars/xsmall_server_vars.yml 
```
- Following vars file can be used with the above command
  - @vars/xsmall_server_vars.yml
  - @vars/small_server_vars.yml
  - @vars/meidum_server_vars.yml
  - @vars/large_server_vars.yml

## Note:
- Vars file contains the default values as mentioned in role variables section above.
- It is recommended:-
  - Create a seperate vars file in working directory.
  - Copy and paste the content of vars file available on github repo in the newly created file.
  - Change the password related variables and encrypt vars file using Ansible Vault.
  - Execute below command in working directory.
  ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ibm.storage_protect.sp_server_blueprint_playbook.yml -e @encrypted_file.yml

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux (x86_64 architecture).
- **Disk Space**: Ensure you satisfy the system requirements for blueprint implementation/installation of server.
- The playbook should be executed with `become: true`.
- Install the following collections from ansible galaxy on control node.
```bash
  ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
  ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
